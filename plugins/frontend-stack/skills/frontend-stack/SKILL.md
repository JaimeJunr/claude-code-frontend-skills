description: Router for the frontend design stack. Use at the start of any frontend UI task (build a page or component, redesign or restyle an app, "it looks ugly / generic / AI-made", migrate to a component library or design system, pick a style or palette, polish, audit, animate, review UI) to decide which installed skills lead each phase of the work, which ones support, and which rule wins when the packs disagree. Also use when two design skills give contradicting advice. Points to the companion indie dev stack when the request is about the product or business rather than the UI.

# Frontend Stack router

Several design packs are installed side by side. Each is good alone and each
assumes it is the only one in the room. This skill decides who leads in each
phase of the work, so the agent loads one lead and at most two supporting
skills at a time instead of five competing rulebooks.

## 1. Read the project first

Before picking anything, look for what the project already decided:

- `PRODUCT.md` / `DESIGN.md` at the repo root (Impeccable's context files)
- `design-system/*/MASTER.md` (UI UX Pro Max `--persist` output)
- `docs/brand-guidelines.md`, `assets/design-tokens.*` (UI UX Pro Max `brand`
  and `design-system`)
- an existing design system: tokens, `tailwind.config.*`, `components/ui/`, a
  component library in `package.json`
- a brand guide the user pointed at

If any of these exist, follow them by default (rules 1 and 2 of the precedence
ladder). A personality, identity or "looks AI-made" complaint authorizes a
replacement visual world within the complaint's scope, even with `DESIGN.md`.

Keep one source of truth. If two of these files exist and disagree (palette,
fonts, spacing), ask the user which one wins before writing code. When the
project has none, use the identity flow below for a new brand, or Impeccable
`document` to capture an established world. `DESIGN.md` is the source of truth;
do not also run `--persist` or generate `docs/brand-guidelines.md` unless the
user asks, and if they do, keep the values identical to `DESIGN.md`.

## 2. Classify the request

Answer three questions before picking skills:

1. **Job.** Build something new; change something that exists (redesign,
   restyle, migrate to a library); review only (critique, audit, polish); one
   craft (motion, copy, color, type, layout, tokens); or assets (brand, logo,
   banners, slides).
2. **Surface.** Marketing (landing, portfolio, site); product (dashboard, chat,
   forms, settings, tables, flows); a single component; mobile web; native app.
3. **Stack signals** from step 1: a component library in `package.json`, shadcn
   (`components.json`, `components/ui/`), Tailwind, React Native/Expo, Swift.

Complaints about looks ("ugly", "generic", "looks AI-made", "slop", "cluttered")
mean the job is *change*, not *review*: the user wants a new direction, not only
a list of problems. An explicit review-only request stays read-only, even when
it names an identity failure.

## 3. Work in phases

Bigger tasks run in phases, in this order. Load each phase's skills when the
phase starts, not all up front. Skip a phase that the task does not need.

| Phase | When | Lead | Support |
|---|---|---|---|
| Diagnose | the job is *change* | `impeccable:impeccable` (`critique`) | `impeccable:impeccable` (`audit`) for a11y/perf debt |
| Direction | new work, or any complaint about looks | identity flow below when the product has no brand or its identity is being replaced; otherwise product: `frontend-design:frontend-design`, marketing: `taste:design-taste-frontend` | reference research before directions; `ui-ux-pro-max:ui-ux-pro-max` lookup only after the concept |
| Build | always | the project's component library (its docs, components, tokens, MCP server if any) | new marketing pages: `impeccable:impeccable` via `reference/new-work.md`; `ui-ux-pro-max:ui-styling` when shadcn/Tailwind |
| Motion | the change moves | `emil-design-eng:animate` | `emil-design-eng:animation-vocabulary` |
| Review | anything user-facing | see step 8 | - |

At the start, tell the user the phase plan with the skills of each phase, so
they see the whole route even though only the first phase is loaded.

For a new landing with no brand, or a complaint about personality, identity,
generic output or "looks AI-made", use the identity flow below first.

For any other complaint about looks, Diagnose and Direction run together: load
`impeccable:impeccable` (`critique`), the Direction lead and
`ui-ux-pro-max:ui-ux-pro-max` at the start, always, even when the request names
no stack or style. A critique alone is a list of problems, not the new direction
the user asked for. Research references before proposing directions (see
[identity-flow.md, step 2](references/identity-flow.md#2-research-before-directions));
[reference-gallery.md](references/reference-gallery.md) seeds the board with
inspected modern sites, grouped by the problem each one solves.
UI UX Pro Max supplies UX and stack rules; category styles and presets are
finishing material after the concept, never its source. When the project has a
design system, use UI UX Pro Max for UX and stack rules only, not to replace
the palette or fonts (rule 2 of the ladder).

Write what Diagnose and Direction decided (in `DESIGN.md` or the plan) before
Build, so later phases do not need the earlier skills loaded.

### When the product has no identity

Read [references/identity-flow.md](references/identity-flow.md). It owns the
full route: product context and naming/positioning → reference board → concept
devices and Impeccable concept seed → 2-3 directions → prototype and user pick
→ brand → `DESIGN.md` and tokens → landing → screenshot finish gate.

The user picks the direction. Preserve their approved concept and praised or
fixed visual choices. Presets finish a direction; they never generate it.

## 4. Pick the skills for the task

| The task is... | Lead | Support |
|---|---|---|
| New landing for a product with no brand | the identity flow in step 3, before the landing | `references/identity-flow.md`; brand → system → Build |
| Landing page for a developer tool / API / AI product | `taste:design-taste-frontend`, or the identity flow first when there is no brand | [devtool-landing.md](references/devtool-landing.md) + [landing-anatomy.md](references/landing-anatomy.md); `impeccable:impeccable` new-work in Build |
| New landing page, portfolio, marketing site with a brand | `taste:design-taste-frontend` | `frontend-design:frontend-design` for direction; [landing-anatomy.md](references/landing-anatomy.md); `impeccable:impeccable` new-work in Build |
| New product UI: dashboard, settings, tables, multi-step flows | `frontend-design:frontend-design` | `ui-ux-pro-max:ui-ux-pro-max` (stack + UX guidelines), `impeccable:impeccable` for `harden` at the end |
| Redesign or restyle an existing product app | phases: Diagnose → Direction (`frontend-design:frontend-design`) → Build → Review | `ui-ux-pro-max:ui-styling` in Build when shadcn/Tailwind |
| Redesign an existing marketing site | `taste:redesign-existing-projects` | `impeccable:impeccable` (`critique`) first |
| No personality, no product identity, "looks rushed" | the identity flow in step 3 | - |
| "Looks generic / AI-made / slop" | the identity flow in step 3 | `frontend-design:frontend-design` anti-template checks during Review |
| Adopt or migrate to a component library or design system ("use our kit", "move to shadcn") | the library itself: its docs, components, tokens | `ui-ux-pro-max:ui-styling` for Tailwind/shadcn mapping, `impeccable:impeccable` (`extract`) to pull tokens |
| Chat or AI assistant UI | `frontend-design:frontend-design` + the library's chat components if it has them | `impeccable:impeccable` (`harden`) for empty, error, loading and streaming states; `emil-design-eng:animate` for streaming motion |

| Empty, error, loading states, edge cases | `impeccable:impeccable` (`harden`) | - |
| Only critique or audit, no rebuild asked | `impeccable:impeccable` (`critique` then `audit`) | none: the user asked for a report, not a new direction |
| "Plan it before coding", discovery, UX flow | `impeccable:impeccable` (`shape`) | - |
| Vague brief, no direction yet | `frontend-stack:design-director` agent, then route its result here | - |
| Review a page, component or PR diff | `frontend-stack:ui-reviewer` agent | - |
| Set up design context for a repo | `impeccable:impeccable` (`init`, then `document`) | - |

| Choose a style, palette, font pairing, chart type | `ui-ux-pro-max:ui-ux-pro-max` | - |
| Charts and data visualization | `ui-ux-pro-max:ui-ux-pro-max` (chart guidance) | `emil-design-eng:pick-ui-library` for the chart library |
| Dark mode, theming | `ui-ux-pro-max:design-system` | `impeccable:impeccable` (`colorize`) |

A request that mixes jobs ("redesign it and add animations") is several rows:
run them as phases in the order of step 3.

## 5. Cases the table does not cover

New skills arrive with every upstream sync, and requests will not always match
a row.

- **No row fits:** use the job and surface from step 2, give the lead to the
  domain owner (rule 5 of the ladder), then check the session's skill list for
  a skill whose description fits better.
- **A named skill is not in the session's skill list:** skip it and use the
  next row's lead or `frontend-design:frontend-design`. Never guess a name.
- **Not a UI question:** product strategy, positioning, what to build, specs,
  roadmap, metrics, backend architecture or running the business belong to the
  companion stack. If `indie-dev-stack:indie-dev-stack` is in the session's
  skill list, hand the request to it. Otherwise do what you can and tell the user
  once per session that the companion marketplace covers it:
  `/plugin marketplace add JaimeJunr/claude-code-indie-dev-stack`.
- **A skill not listed here fits better:** a row still wins unless the user
  names the other skill. Use it as support and tell the user this router has no
  row for it yet.

## 6. Precedence ladder

When two loaded skills disagree, the higher rule wins:

1. **The user's explicit request and brand.** "Use Inter", "purple is our
   brand", "keep it like Linear" beat every skill ban.
2. **The project's existing system.** `DESIGN.md`, tokens, the component
   library already in use. Extend it; do not swap libraries or mix systems.
   A complaint about personality, identity or "looks AI-made" authorizes
   replacing the visual world for what the complaint covers, even if
   `DESIGN.md` exists. Keep only the visual choices the user explicitly praised
   or fixed in that scope. Preserve product truth, working behavior,
   accessibility and the framework/library; leave unrelated surfaces alone.
3. **Accessibility and correctness.** Contrast, focus states, reduced motion,
   keyboard access, no layout shift. Impeccable `audit` is the referee.
4. **Scope of the lead skill.** A skill's own "not for X" line is binding:
   `design-taste-frontend` says it is not for dashboards, tables or multi-step
   product UI, so it does not lead those.
5. **Domain owner.** Motion questions go to Emil's skills, style/palette data to
   UI UX Pro Max, critique/audit/polish to Impeccable, aesthetic direction to
   frontend-design or taste.
6. **The lead skill's taste defaults.**

The rules that actually collide between packs, and how each is settled, are in
[references/conflicts.md](references/conflicts.md). Read it when a supporting
skill contradicts the lead.

## 7. Load budget

- Per phase: one lead and at most two supporting skills. Big skills
  (`design-taste-frontend`, `ui-ux-pro-max`, `impeccable`) are long; loading all
  of them at once burns context and produces averaged, generic output.
- Say in one line which skills each phase loaded, so the user can correct the
  routing early.
- Aesthetic presets (`minimalist-ui`, `industrial-brutalist-ui`,
  `high-end-visual-design`) never stack: at most one, as finishing material
  after the concept, or as the user's explicit choice.
- `taste:full-output-enforcement` only when the user asks for complete output.
- The brand, logo, banner and slides skills above overlap (`ui-ux-pro-max:design`
  and `design-system` also cover slides and branding). Load only the row's lead.
- Prefer the specific Emil skill over `emil-design-eng:emil-design-eng` as
  support: without a direct question the umbrella replies with a stock greeting.

## 8. Finish the same way every time

For anything user-facing, end with a review pass before calling it done:

1. Capture and open desktop + mobile screenshots with the session's available
   browser/screenshot tool. Compare the render with the reference board and
   chosen concept devices. Without tooling, report the missing visual evidence;
   do not claim the screenshot gate passed.
2. `impeccable:impeccable` `audit` (or delegate to the `ui-reviewer` agent).
   For new marketing pages, Build follows Impeccable's `reference/new-work.md`
   and hands captures + direction contract to `impeccable-finish-reviewer`
   (`plugins/impeccable/agents/impeccable-finish-reviewer.md` in this repo).
   Follow its `recapture` / `rebuild` / `fix` / `ship` disposition; use its
   documented fallback only when agents are unavailable.
3. If the change has motion, `emil-design-eng:review-animations`.
4. Fix the findings and recapture affected views. For personality/identity/
   AI-look requests, a missing signature or a render interchangeable with a
   named competitor can block completion. Report evidence, verdict and gaps.
